# My README
#Hello,
#My name is Eren, I'm a Junior Industrial Engineering and Economics Double Major student in Sabanci University. 
#I'm currently taking the Introduction to Data Science course, coded CS210, and  for  my term project, as I am a fond of watching films and series, I decided to conduct a data science project on my Netflix watch time. 
#I imported my files that are imported from Netflix as CSV into Python and analyzed me (and my parents) watching habits. The detailed explanation of my project, and the project code itself can be found in my respitory.
#I wish this project finds you well.
